Prototype of execution bot

Current functionality: Bot is capable of placing trades on market condition of market price for stock crosses particular Standard Moving Average(SMA). 
     
Limitations: Bot requires over 3+ trades to execute unhindered. Unfortunately market requirements for more than 3 day trades per week require a $25,000 total account value. Postponement of full testing until that requirement is met.
