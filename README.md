Prototype of execution bot

Current functionality: Bot is capable of placing trades on market condition of market price for stock crosses particular Standard Moving Average(SMA). 
     
Limitations: Bot requires over 3+ trades to execute unhindered. Unfortunately market requirements for more than 3 day trades per week require a $25,000 total account value. Postponing my own full testing until that requirement is met. However, bot is available to anyone that would like to use it.

Requires td ameritrade account to operate. As a td user, you must also request an api key to place in the respective place in the code of the filt "get_token.py" 

Get token file must be run first in order to establish correct file set. (will show up as a file directory where main.py is located)
Google Selenium chromedriver must be downloaded and added to project file directory (same file where main.py is located)
Be sure to change file names to appropriate corresponding locations in your own computer.
